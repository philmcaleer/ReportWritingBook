</h3>
<p>No. A lot of materials on writing reports will tell you to do this or to do that. In the vast majority of cases this advice will be nothing more than that, advice, not hard and fast rules. That said, that advice is often given based on what makes a better reading experience for your intended audience and so is worth paying attention to. There will of course be some rules, on aspects such as presentation of information, values, citations, etc and, given that we use APA 7th edition, it is worth referring to this webpage and the instructional aids there for pointers on that aspect: <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines" target="_blank">https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines</a></p>

</h3>
<p>Again no one real answer but one key thing to keep in mind is your reader. Often we fall into the trap of thinking solely as the writer, because we are writing the report, and forget about the reader. So one good bit of advice is to write like a writer and redraft like a reader. This means that when you are redrafting your work, take a perspective of a reader who knows about psychology but perhaps does not know this topic so well. This will help you spot where ideas and information are not as clear as they could be - there is some evidence to suggest that reading your work out loud can help spot issues when redrafting as you, the writer, are having to slow down to read it, to a pace similar to the novel reader: <a href="https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2022/10/20-1">"When redrafting read out loud"</a>. We also recommend this student guide to scientific writing by <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/r4sfz/">Carpenter (2020)</a> for some principles and skills to work on.</p>

<p>Best to check the Assessment Information Sheet on Moodle. We believe it is better to have one document that has all the correct information rather than multiple documents having conflicting information so we will keep that answer to the AIS.</p>
<div id="is-there-a-recommended-word-count-for-each-part-of-the-report" class="section level3" number="7.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Is there a recommended word count for each part of the report?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-there-a-recommended-word-count-for-each-part-of-the-report"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>So in terms of word count, whilst there is no specific hard and fast word count for each section a good ballpark is something like a third, a third, a third. Third on introduction, third on discussion, third on the methods, results, abstract. Don't take that verbatim though and see it just as a ballpark. We would suggest that the introduction and discussion should balance (meaning you should try to avoid having a very long introduction and a very small discussion, or vice versa), and any words we can save from the Methods and Results, we would use that space in the Introduction and Discussion to add more depth or support. Methods and Results are formulaic and detailed, they don't need a lot of expansion - so if you can get the detail across in less words then those spare words we would put into the introduction and discussion. The introduction and discussion of a paper do a lot of the heavy lifting basically.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-we-need-to-include-an-abstract" class="section level3" number="7.1.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> Do we need to include an Abstract?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-to-include-an-abstract"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yes. Estimate somewhere around 250 words for the abstract. In reality most abstracts will be around 200-250 words and that allows more words for other parts. Main thing is that the Abstract covers the key parts of Area, Aim, Methods, Results, Conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-included-in-the-word-count" class="section level3" number="7.1.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> What is included in the word count?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-included-in-the-word-count"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>An easier way is to say what is not included in the word count. The title, the references, and the appendices (if you have any) are the only things not included in the word count. Everything else - including figure legends, table legends, values in tables, citations, etc, and all the text from the abstract to the end of the discussion, are included in the word count</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-abbreviations-1" class="section level3" number="7.1.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.4</span> Can we use abbreviations?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-abbreviations-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Abbreviations are really not great for readers - they are only good for writers in that it helps them save space. For a reader it creates a high cognitive demand as they try to remember what the abbreviation stood for, ultimately distracting them from reading and understanding what you are writing - an example here might be using SE for Self-Efficacy and IM for Intrinsic Motivation. Once you have written your paper these abbreviations might be very clear to you, but taking this approach makes the writing very hard to understand for the reader, and we would discourage it at all times. The exception here is questionnaires (e.g. MSLQ) and well-known techniques or methods (e.g. MRI, MEG, EEG) but remember to state the phrase out in full in the first instance.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-quotations-from-previous-work-1" class="section level3" number="7.1.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.5</span> Can we use quotations from previous work?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-quotations-from-previous-work-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Technically this is allowed but would be better if you didn't and just rephrased the writing in your own words. For one, quotations change the tone of the writing from your tone to that of the other writer. More importantly, when you use a quotation, and don't go into depth about the meaning of that quotation, you are relying on the reader getting the exact same meaning from the quotation that you did but they are only getting the quotation and are not getting any of the context. A much better approach is to restate the meaning of what you want to say so that it fits and flows with the surrounding context of your writing.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-do-not-or-dont" class="section level3" number="7.1.6">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.6</span> Can we use do not or don't?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-do-not-or-dont"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Do not use don't and other such shortenings like can't and shouldn't. Instead use do not etc. Remember academic tone! Contractions, as they are called, are fine for informal writing in lay summaries, blogs and webpages. For an academic report though they are considered bad practice and should be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-footnotes" class="section level3" number="7.1.7">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.7</span> Can we use footnotes?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-footnotes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We would say no. They are not the done thing in academic reports in Psychology so best avoided. Again they are not conducive to an easy reading experience of the reader - the reader has to move their eyes from where they were reading to the bottom of the page to find the footnote and then back to where they were reading in the page. This prevents a flow of information in your writing and so are best avoided.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-write-i-or-we-in-our-report" class="section level3" number="7.1.8">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.8</span> Can we write 'I' or 'we' in our report?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-write-i-or-we-in-our-report"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yes. In this specific report you could use “We” because it started as a group effort or you could use "I" as ultimately it is you doing the analysis and writing. More seasoned (a nice word for older) members of the team find it easier to write "We" as science is rarely just a singular person doing something but both approaches are fine here. We would however avoid using "The research team" and just state "we" - active voice is easier to read than passive voice.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-you-use-subheadings-in-an-introduction-and-a-discussion" class="section level3" number="7.1.9">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.9</span> Can you use subheadings in an Introduction and a Discussion?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-you-use-subheadings-in-an-introduction-and-a-discussion"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yes. There is no rule against this. The question is really do you need them? Often when people use subheadings in an introduction and discussion it leads them to write separate sections in the introduction and the different parts are not connected or joined in any way and it reads like different reports in the one introduction. If you do use subheadings try to think about your writing and aim to still connect the different sections and show they are interlinked in some fashion. Even a simple sentence like "A second important question related to Self-Efficacy is..." This at least shows some brief acknowledgement of the first section and that everything is tied to self-efficacy and questions around it. Do remember though that subheadings count in the word count and if your sections are interlinked then you probably don't need them.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-there-an-appropriate-number-of-citations-to-use-in-a-report" class="section level3" number="7.1.10">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.10</span> Is there an appropriate number of citations to use in a report?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-there-an-appropriate-number-of-citations-to-use-in-a-report"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is a tough thing to answer as there is no right answer but you basically want to watch out for too few and too many citations. Particularly when you have a word count. You need to be careful of giving a whole lot of citations (5, 6, 7, etc) to support a point when two or three would have done. At one point you start taking away words that you could have used to clarify the point better for the reader. So that is really the thing you are trying to do - make sure a point is clear and is supported. Some people aim for about two or three citations to show a point is supported, but that is really rough and sometimes it might be 4 or it might be 1 depending on how well supported the point actually is. If only one paper has looked at something then I can only cite one paper. If it helps, some journals recommend no more than 40 citations for a 3000-4000 article and you are probably not too far wrong if you aim for something like that.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-you-use-citations-differently-in-different-parts-of-the-introduction" class="section level3" number="7.1.11">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.11</span> Do you use citations differently in different parts of the introduction?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-you-use-citations-differently-in-different-parts-of-the-introduction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Whilst there is no rule here, some tend to be a bit heavy on citations in the opening paragraph of an introduction, and here you might see the citations per point creep up a little as people set the scene and just try to give a broad overview. After that first paragraph the tendency is to only use numerous citations where needed. Really, making sure the detail comes across - whatever detail you need your reader to focus on - is better than 4 or 5 additional citations beyond the two or three that already showed the point. The distinction here is that, at the start, you are less focused on details and more focused on general findings, so you add a few additional citations maybe, whereas the further you get into the introduction the more detail you tend to pull out, so the citations get a little less heavy and a lot more focused. In addition, from a purely blunt word count perspective, one way to think about it is that if we say on average a citation is four words - citation et al., 20XX - if three citations show the point but you add 7 citations to really hammer it home, then those 4 additional citations use up 16 words that could have been used elsewhere. Ultimately it is always a trade-off sadly but hopefully that gives some insight!</p>
</div>
<div id="can-you-summarise-the-issues-of-too-few-and-too-many-citations" class="section level3" number="7.1.12">

</h3>
<p>Again this is trying to put a number on something that doesn't really have a rule in the world. The main thing to think about is showing support for points and showing relevant detail to help the reader understand the point you are making. You are the expert and your role is to convey information to a reader efficiently. But to try to give two points to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using one citation or repeatedly using the same citation suggests a limited background to the research and doesn't give the reader a good sense of what is already know. All the information is taken from one perspective. Imagine hearing about an incident or an event where you only here it from one person. They might give you lots of detail but you can't verify it is supported by others.</li>
<li>Using lots and lots of citations may lead to running out of words and whilst the reader sees the support for the point, the point you are making, in itself, might not be clear and may be lacking the detail that the reader needs to understand what is being talked about. Imagine hearing about an incident or an event from lots and lots of people. In this instance you get to know that a lot of people are talking about the incident but you probably can't take in all the details or the details are short as you are trying to hear from everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the trade-off of detail and support is the balance you are aiming for when thinking about how many citations to include.</p>

<div id="what-is-critical-evaluation" class="section level3" number="7.1.13">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.1.13</span> What is Critical Evaluation?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-critical-evaluation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This paragraph below has had all the points of critical evaluation highlighted in bold.</p>
<p>"In regard to perceived trustworthiness, <strong>as with dominance in females, few</strong> studies have specifically targeted the effect of vocal pitch on this trait, <strong>with results proving largely inconsistent.</strong> In male voices, two studies exploring the effect of vocal pitch on election voting and personality traits <strong>found contrasting results;</strong> Tigue et al. (2012) found that low-pitched candidates were perceived as more trustworthy, <strong>whereas</strong> Klofstad et al. (2012) found no significant preference in pitch with regard to trustworthiness. <strong>Similarly,</strong> exploring the effect of seeking short- versus long-term relationships, Vukovic et al. (2011) showed no significant preference in male pitch when female participants judged the voices for trustworthiness. <strong>However,</strong> McAleer et al. (2014) found that high-pitched male voices were rated as more trustworthy compared with low-pitched voices. Considering trustworthiness in female voices, <strong>as is the case with dominance, there is a lack of studies, and again a lack of consistent findings.</strong> Klofstad et al. (2012) found that low-pitched female speakers were judged as being more trustworthy in a political scenario, <strong>while, in contrast,</strong> McAleer et al. (2014) found that trustworthiness in female voices was not influenced by average voice pitch but by the vocal glide and intonation; how the pitch moves. <strong>In short, in both genders, there is a lack of studies examining the role of pitch and the preference of high versus low pitch in trustworthiness judgments, with previous findings having failed to provide a consistent answer.</strong>"</p>
<p>If we now look at this version of the paragraph where the critical evaluation has been removed but communication and research has, to some degree, been maintained:</p>
<p>"In regard to perceived trustworthiness studies have looked at the effect of vocal pitch on this trait. In male voices, two studies exploring the effect of vocal pitch on election voting and personality traits are Tigue et al. (2012) who found that low-pitched candidates were perceived as more trustworthy, and Klofstad et al. (2012) who found no significant preference in pitch with regard to trustworthiness. Looking at the effect of seeking short- versus long-term relationships, Vukovic et al. (2011) showed no significant preference in male pitch when female participants judged the voices for trustworthiness. McAleer et al. (2014) found that high-pitched male voices were rated as more trustworthy compared with low-pitched voices. Considering trustworthiness in female voices, Klofstad et al.

<p>Hopefully what you can see, in the first version, is that the critical evaluation parts are turning the paragraph from a purely descriptive list of findings, in the second version, into a discussion about how previous findings relate to each other (how they compare, align, contrast), and how they all come together in your report to help build the argument/rationale for your work (or the rationale for your theory). This paragraph comes from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0301006616643675" target="_blank">Tsantani et al., 2016</a>. Our thanks to Eniko Dobos for help in creating this example.</p>

<p>This blog is one that we quite like: <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/how-to-write-paragraphs-in-research-texts-articles-books-and-phds/" target="_blank">How to write paragraphs</a>. We do not agree with everything it says, in particular point 5 that a paragraph can't be more than 250 words, but a lot of the other points to watch out for are really helpful, and the general overall principle of the structure of a paragraph is helpful as well - you may also know it as the Point, Evidence, Explain, Link approach we looked at earlier in the semester.</p>

</h3>
<p>This is not essential but normally we ask that you include your answers to the first 5 questions from the pre-registration as an appendix to the full report. Do not worry if you forget this though as it is not essential and just recommended. You can include the code as well if that is easier but again not essential. Having the pre-registration as an appendix helps the reader check things if they are uncertain.</p>

</h3>
<p>Yes but this must not be used as a means to save words. For example, you can say "We excluded participants based on the criteria of under 21, male and mature student (see Appendix A)" but you can't say "We excluded participants based on criteria (see Appendix A)". The report has to stand alone and as such <strong>all relevant information should be contained in the full report, not just the Pre-Registration</strong>.</p>

</h3>
<p>Absolutely. You should definitely use the same research and citations, at least to start off from. You can also make the same points though just watch the wording and trying to make sure that the phrasing is in your own tone and in your own words. In short, the pre-registration is a snapshot of what you are doing. The full report is a deeper expansion on those ideas.</p>

<p>No! Really no! The pre-registration is just a template to help you think about what you want to do with your data. The results from the pre-registration should not be talked about in the full report.</p>

</h3>
<p>The real question is "should you change your pre-registration?" The answer to that would be no, we would probably suggest just leaving the pre-registration as is and writing about the deviation briefly as we showed in the Results section. To do good and honest science involves having to write up some of the issues we encounter. That is fine!</p>

<p>Ultimately we will grade and give feedback on the full report you submit. It is unadvised to change the pre-registration because you won't have any feedback on it, and your grade for the pre-registration won't change, but ultimately we will grade and give feedback on the full report you submit and not on the pre-registration.</p>
