</h3>
<p>No. Some of the questions on the MSLQ are meant to be reverse scored but you do not need to worry about this as it is done for you in the study we run - in the programme. The data you get is ready just to be summarised and does not need to be reverse scored. If you did reverse score the data we give you that would be undoing what needs to be done and would give you misleading results. So no reverse scoring needed here.</p>

</h3>
<p>One approach here would be to calculate the standard deviation of each participant. Anyone with a standard deviation of 0 or NA for their responses have responded with exactly the same answer to each question. For example, someone who responds 1, 1, 1, has a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0. There are other approaches but that is potentially the quickest. One thing to note though is that some refer to this response pattern as "straightlining". Not all fields use this terms so it would be good to explain what the term means if you use it - e.g. "Straightlining, meaning that.... (citation), will be detected by...."</p>

</h3>
<p>The assumptions of a test are the characteristics of the data that should be checked and verified before running an analytical test on it to ensure that the output of the data can be considered valid. The assumptions of the different tests are in the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book so you could refer back to the specific chapters to remind yourself: <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/" class="uri">https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/</a></p>

</h3>
<p>Go beyond this and state how you will check them. It isn't enough just to tell a reader what the assumptions of a test are as they probably know that and could just look that up in a textbook and that is not the point of a pre-registration. The pre-registration is you saying what you will do. So try to state what the assumptions are and how you will check them. There is a variety of methods covered in the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book. You do not have to use every single one but you would want to use enough to cover the assumptions.</p>

</h3>
<p>There is a lot of debate here but for now it is perfectly acceptable to just use the methods and approaches we have shown you in the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book. In short, visualisations is fine as long as you state what you are doing - scatterplot, boxplot, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-we-use-residuals-for-assumption-checks" class="section level3" number="5.0.6">

<span class="header-section-number">5.0.6</span> Should we use residuals for assumption checks?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-we-use-residuals-for-assumption-checks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Ideally you would use residuals and this is what is shown in the t-test chapter of the data skills book. The correlation chapter just uses the raw data as we had not yet introduced residuals by that point but it mentions that it is better to use the residuals. However, please note that for this assignment it is totally fine to stick to what the book actually shows you - i.e. it would be fine to use the original data for the correlation and the residuals for t-tests.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.0.7</span> What are residuals again?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-residuals-again"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Really residuals are the difference between two data points. Normally, when thinking about assumptions it is the difference between say a participants individual score and the mean score of the sample. In that example, if someone has a large residual then their data is far from the mean score; low residual would mean their data is close to the mean score.</p>

</h3>
<p>Best plot here is usually a scatterplot with a line of best fit. There is a good example of this in the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book. You are looking to see that the data points are captured by the line of best fit - where captured really means something like that line is cutting the data in half with an equal spread of points above and below the line.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-the-data-from-the-mslq-ordinal-or-interval" class="section level3" number="5.0.9">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.0.9</span> Is the data from the MSLQ ordinal or interval?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-the-data-from-the-mslq-ordinal-or-interval"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There is a very grey area in research here when using scales like the MSLQ as to whether it is treated as ordinal or interval. As this is still a learning process we are happy for people to take either stance. Note though if you say the data is interval (or could be considered interval) then you analyse it as interval data. If you say the data is ordinal then you analyse it as ordinal. You can't say in a paper that the data is ordinal but we will analyse it as interval as that doesn't make sense. It is ok to take a stance here and say we are treating the data as interval and therefore the assumption of interval data holds. It is even better if you can justify it with a paper such as "based on.......we are treating the data as interval.....". Perhaps look at some previous papers using the MSLQ to see what they did - the original paper calculated Means and Standard Deviations on the scales for example and are as such treating it as Interval. But again this comes down to justifying your decisions and showing support for them through citation.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-we-know-if-data-is-paired-or-independent" class="section level3" number="5.0.10">

<span class="header-section-number">5.0.10</span> How do we know if data is paired or independent?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-do-we-know-if-data-is-paired-or-independent"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This is really about understanding the design of the study. Paired means that the two data points come from the same participant. Independent means that the two data points come from different participants. So comparing females vs non-binary is independent because the data comes from two different sets of participants. Looking at the correlation between participants' Intrinsic motivation and test anxiety is paired because you have data from participants on both scales. So some assumptions are about just restating the design and some are about checking the data.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Pearson correlation and the Welch's between-subjects t-test are parametric tests that rely on using the means of the raw data and are based around the Normal distribution. They have a number of assumptions about the data that should be checked and met (or verified) before being used. If the data does not meet the assumptions then it is likely you would use the non-parametric version of the tests or some other alternative. In this assignment, the most likely alternatives would be the Spearman rho correlation (a non-parametric alternative to the Pearson) and the Mann-Whitney U-test (a non-parametric alternative to between-subjects t-tests). That said, there is a degree of accepted violation in assumption tests and there are a number of papers that might suggest skews, for example, are not that much of a concern assuming the sample is large enough. Again try to build in citations to show support when you can.</p>

</h3>
<p>This depends on what you are saying. If you were to say for example that we will first check all assumptions of the pearson correlation and if the data is verified then we will use the Pearson correlation, that does not need a citation as that is standard procedure. If however you say we will check the assumptions of normality, linearity, homoscedasticity, and outliers, and even if they are all fine we will run a spearman correlation, then you would want to give some justification and citation to support it. Again, comes down to what are you using the citation for.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-we-need-to-justify-using-a-students-between-subjects-t-test-or-using-welchs-between-subjects-t-test-with-citations" class="section level3" number="5.0.13">

</h3>
<p>Student's between-subjects t-test is still the norm in the field so we would probably put a citation to justify using the Welch's between-subjects t-test over the Student's between-subjects t-test. This paper can help: <a href="https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.82/" class="uri">https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.82/</a></p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.0.14</span> How can we determine outliers?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-can-we-determine-outliers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are numerous ways to determine something as an outlier - such as using a boxplot or using 2 or 3 SD from the mean value or giving a response that is really far from other participants - but they won't always apply to your data so it is up to you as a research team to decide what is an outlier for you. As Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti says in this tweet - <a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1438506708939116556?s=20">https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1438506708939116556?s=20</a> - "We get rid of outliers when their extremeness indicates they are not part of our population, we do not get rid of them solely because they are extreme." In short, you as a research team decide what an outlier is based on your reading of papers and what you are thinking and discussing in your groups. Alternatively, if yous decide nothing is an outlier then state that and justify it. This is one paper that shows a whole plethora of ways to find outliers and we am showing it just to show that there are too many ways to list - what is important in your writing is why you state the approaches you do: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1094428112470848" class="uri">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1094428112470848</a>. And it is similar idea for other exclusion criteria - for example, if you think someone who gives the same response to every answer is genuine and you want to include them then that is fine. If you think they are cheating and you want to exclude them that is also fine. The key thing is being able to support your decision with rationale and citations if possible.</p>

</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You do not have to think of everything. Nobody can.</li>
<li>You do want to try and think the experiment through - what might people do/respond that means they are excluded/included. Perhaps even try the study again and think about this as you are doing it.</li>
<li>Try and include justification/citations for aspects where needed. Let's say your test is to look at Undergraduate vs Postgraduate, you don't need a citation to exclude anyone who has not responded to that question, you would just state that you only include people that label as postgrduate or undergraduate. If however you want to remove anyone who responds the exact same answer for every question in the questionnaire then you would try to give a citation for that as there is debate as to whether that is a valid removal or not. See the distinction? One is just what you are studying. The other is a decision you have made that may impact the outcome of your study.</li>

</h3>
<p>One way to get an idea about exclusion/inclusion criteria is reading methods sections of papers that have used the same questionnaire as you, or a related questionnaire, or just ran the study in a similar fashion (online studies)For example: A paper from members of our team: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204991#sec002" class="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204991#sec002</a> where we removed people based on responses. Or a paper by other members of the team where they stated there were no exclusion criteria: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214261#sec002" class="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214261#sec002</a> Or a paper that states they exclude based on the completion of tests: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.761580/full#h7" class="uri">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.761580/full#h7</a> So there is a whole range of reasons to exclude or include people. Again it isn't about listing everything. It is about trying to think about what might be relevant to what you are studying. We are not looking for an exhaustive list. Instead it is about justifying the decisions you do make. Much of research is thinking forward so it would be worthwhile spending a bit of time brainstorming with your group on things you have read and potential inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p>

<p>Yes but even better if you can find a citation to support your decision - perhaps there is work out there that argues this exact point that all values on a scale are valid so should be included or even says they took this same approach. There might not be but there might. The point is really just trying to support your decisions where possible. You won't find a citation for everything but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try first.</p>

<p>If you can find a citation for this then it is better to include it than not - and that is really true of all decisions you make. A citation for this would be a paper that suggests this is an acceptable approach to outliers or one that uses this approach to remove outliers in a related study. Long story short though, if you have a citation for a decision then use it.</p>

</h3>
<p>There is really no right or wrong approach here and again it comes down to justifying what you are doing if possible. Some would say you should remove them, some would say you shouldn't, and some would say it depends. A couple of things to think about. How many questions could a participant acceptably miss and still give you valid data? If they miss one question is that ok? What about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 80%? Basically, what is the acceptable miss rate and what is unacceptable? Clearly the more they missed you could argue that they were not paying attention. Alternatively, perhaps they didn't want to answer for some reason. Either way you have to decide if that data is useful to you or not. On the flipside, how hard is it to get your participants? If your sample is going to be small in the first place, if you then have a rule about removing everyone that missed one question then you might be reducing your sample even more. So there really is a variety of different ways of working here and taking a stance one way or the other is fine. In future studies that you run you might want to think about adding attention checks into the study to make these decisions ever so slightly easier.</p>

</h3>
<p>So for example, say you were wanting to test males vs females and therefore exclude anyone that does not identify as male or female. In this situation you would probably not need to really justify excluding those that don't identify as male or female because it is inherent to the study that you only test those that identify as such. Here instead we might just explicitly state that as the research question is specifically about male versus female then we will only include people that identify as such. That is fine. The one thing however you might want to make sure you do is add some rationale/justification to the Pre-Registration (most likely in Question 1) as to why you are just looking at male versus female - perhaps for example that follows what others have done so far so you are building on that work.</p>

</h3>
<p>The answer is yes but can you justify it and can you explain it. A rough example would be say you want to split students into mature vs traditional based on age. So one approach is to just take all the ages and say, randomly, anyone below this age is traditional and one above this age is mature. That is not a brilliant approach as there is no support or evidence to back it up. A better approach would be to say something like, "We will categorise everyone below the age of ..... as traditional and everyone above that age as mature, based on ........." and in that last part supplying some support through citation of research or standard procedures at a given University or funding body.</p>

<p>Yes but it might give you a lot of issues but as long as you are comfortable with that then that is fine. This was a free response answer, meaning that people wrote in what they liked. Say you wanted to use Psychology students only - some might write Psychology, Psych, psychology, psych, or any other spelling of Psychology given how hard it is to spell. And then over and above that, many might have just skipped this question as they couldn't be bothered writing when everything else can be done by the mouse. So in short, yes you can do this but it might take a bit of extra effort.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this study/assignment it would only be bad practice if you can't justify your criteria - for instance, doing a study just on non-binary people will remove a lot of data but that is fine if you justify why you are just looking at non-binary (most likely in Question 1 of the Pre-Registration). In future studies that you might run yourself it would be better to not capture data from people and on variables that you were not interested in and you would plan restrictions on how you collect your data to prevent this.</p>

</h3>
<p>Deciding on an appropriate effect size to use in the power calculation is at the researchers discretion and there are different ways to determine what value to use. You essentially need to decide what is the smallest meaningful effect size you are actually interested in and there is no set answer to that; one common approach is to look at the existing published literature and see what is the average size that is reported when investigating your topic. Certain research areas are typically only interested in at least medium to large effect sizes/ correlations, since they argue that anything smaller is of no practical value. Other research areas may be interested in smaller effect sizes, since they might argue that even though the effect is small, if it is consistent and statistically significant then over time these small effects can have a cumulative effect. So it really depends on what you are investigating, what is common in that area, and what you think you might actually be interested in. The best approach is always to justify your effect size - "Based on ....... we will explore......." - but just to reiterate there is no real one correct answer and it is purely about justifying the decision of the effect size in some way. Again, remember the citations to support what you are saying.</p>

</h3>
<p>One effect size for each test you run is the normal thinking. So if you run one t-test then it is one effect size of interest. Please note that if you run more than one correlation and more than one t-test then that would require more effect sizes. Again it is one effect size per test. It may be the case that if you run more than one t-test then each t-test you are interested in has the same size of effect, so they are all d = .4, for example, but just be sure to make that clear in the writing that you are acknowledging an effect size for each test. For example, "all tests were based on...." and again try to give citations to support why you are working towards a given effect size.</p>

<p>Actually you can, and often a quick search on google, e.g. "Pearson r to Cohen d", will show you some options. One good site is: <a href="https://www.escal.site/" class="uri">https://www.escal.site/</a> The reason this is possible will become evident in future years of study but, in short, a number of the inferential tests that we use (t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs, regression) are all part of the General Linear Model, and the output of one can be converted into another, and as such one effect size can be converted into another.</p>

</h3>
<p>There is some debate here but we will give you one perspective. So it can help to separate, in your mind, hypotheses and the tails of a test. They are related but not the same thing. The hypothesis is what you predict, and the tails relate to what you actually test. So you can predict a directional effect (e.g. a positive correlation in your hypothesis) but when it comes to running your test you can still test one-tailed or two-tailed. This is not a problem and it is not cheating. Most research probably still states a directional hypothesis but will test with a two-tailed test. Reasons for this include skepticism of one-tailed tests due to previous misuse of them in research but also the two-tailed test allows you to be wrong in your prediction and to still find an effect if there is one to be found. If you test with a one-tailed test then you can only look for an effect or relationship in the direction predicted - predict a positive correlation and can only look for a positive correlation. That is fine if the relationship was positive, but if the relationship was negative then you can't ever find it. You have missed it. If you predict a positive relationship, test two-tailed, and it comes back that the relationship was actually a negative relationship, you can still find it because you said I am going to allow myself to be wrong and to test both directions. Whilst this might sound like cheating because you are looking both ways, the thing to remember is that when you test with a two-tailed test, it is harder to find an effect because your cut-offs are larger as to what would be determined significant. But going back to the question - as we are using pre-registration it is fine to state either a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test as you are stating in advance what you are doing. Again just try to justify the decisions you make.</p>

</h3>
<p>This depends on how you plan to run your analysis. If you plan a one-tailed test then you would use greater or lesser depending on the direction you hypothesise. If you plan a two-tailed test then you would use two.sided. Please however do make sure that these match. If you argue for a one-tailed test in your writing but run a two-tailed test in your code then there is a mismatch here that will affect your outcome.</p>

</h3>
<p>First just to clarify - alternative hypothesis is basically the hypothesis that is not the null regardless of whether you are stating a direction or no direction. Back to the question - no as this would really just use up words needlessly. Again it isn't wrong in a paper to state both the null and the alternative it just isn't needed. Most papers will state the alternative as once you know the alternative then you know the null - the null just says there is no difference or no relationship etc so it doesn't need explicitly stated if you explicitly state the alternative hypothesis.</p>

</h3>
<p>So actually this is bad practice for a number of reasons and we would discourage you from doing so. You will see people do it in papers but really it is a result of poor editing more often than not. One reason not to do it are that H1 is the statistical abbreviation of the alternative hypothesis (H0 is the null). There is no H2 in statistics and having H1, H2 is really confusing for anyone that knows this. Another reason not to do this is that it likely means that you have used a bullet point somewhere, labelling the two hypotheses and that is not good writing.</p>

</h3>
<p>First, if you are only running one test - as you will most likely be doing here - then a multiple comparison is not needed and you can turn it off or not state it. Multiple comparison corrections are performed to help maintain the false positive rate at around the chosen level that we say we test at - with the field standard being alpha = .05 (1 in 20 studies). When you run more studies and analyses you actually increase the false positive rate based on the Family Wise Error Rate; meaning that the false positive rate increases and you are more likely to find a false positive. If you run multiple analyses on the same data you should correct for multiple comparisons in order to maintain the false positive rate at the required level. This becomes slightly a grey area for people when it is different analyses on the same data with some arguing that you don't need to correct and others arguing that you do need to correct. The conservative approach is to correct for multiple comparisons regardless with the two most common approaches being Holm (sometimes called Holm-Bonferroni) and Bonferroni.</p>

</h3>
<p>Bonferroni was the standard for a long time but this is maybe simply due to the fact that it is simple to do by hand and by code. Holm is argued to be as effective as Bonferroni in controlling false positives and to have greater statistical power because it has less false negatives (lower Beta; higher Power because Power = 1 - Beta). All that said, this is an incredibly difficult part of statistics to understand and for this assignment it is fine to just use either, neither or none, and try to state why if possible with citation to support.</p>
