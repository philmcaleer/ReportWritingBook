<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.1</span> What is Pre-Registration?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-pre-registration"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As part of the process of improving the published research that comes out of Psychology following the reproducibility and replication crisis was the drive to encourage people to pre-register their studies more. In short this means that people write out in advance what they plan to do, why they plan to do it, and to note as many of the decisions they will make in advance of actually running the study. Here in this assignment we want you to use your knowledge and skills to do a pre-registration and to think about, decide, and justify your decisions in advance of running and writing up a full analysis</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-justify-mean" class="section level3" number="1.0.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.2</span> What does justify mean?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-does-justify-mean"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In this sense, justify means to effectively state why you are doing something and to give support to that decision in advance if possible. For instance, with a really rough example, it is the difference between saying, "We hypothesise that....." versus "Based on previous research which showed.......(citation, citation), we hypothesise that....." The second example has support and shows justification. The first example merely states what you are doing. Pre-Registration is better when it is justified where possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="doesnt-a-pre-registration-box-you-into-doing-what-you-state-and-what-if-i-think-of-something-after-the-pre-registration-and-want-to-do-that-in-the-final-study" class="section level3" number="1.0.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.3</span> Doesn't a pre-registration box you into doing what you state? And what if I think of something after the pre-registration and want to do that in the final study?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#doesnt-a-pre-registration-box-you-into-doing-what-you-state-and-what-if-i-think-of-something-after-the-pre-registration-and-want-to-do-that-in-the-final-study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Pre-Registration is not meant to be seen as a prison or a hole you can't escape from. It is just about being transparent with what you are doing. That means that if something goes wrong with the data or you think of something after the pre-registration, that is totally fine - you just state that in the final report and state what you did and why. So you can change things after; you just need to justify why.</p>
</div>
<div id="within-our-project-group-how-many-pre-registrations-should-there-be" class="section level3" number="1.0.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.4</span> Within our Project Group how many Pre-Registrations should there be?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#within-our-project-group-how-many-pre-registrations-should-there-be"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One. Within your group you should come together to complete the one pre-registration document that looks to address the research questions and hypotheses that you as a group have decided to explore.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-every-member-of-the-group-have-to-write-a-section-of-the-pre-registration-document" class="section level3" number="1.0.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.5</span> Does every member of the group have to write a section of the Pre-Registration document?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#does-every-member-of-the-group-have-to-write-a-section-of-the-pre-registration-document"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>No. How you work within your group and how you come together to produce the final document is up to you. Perhaps two are more comfortable doing the coding and they will work on that bit, and the others work on the writing. Or even perhaps one person does the writing and the rest generate and build ideas. In the end this is a group submission and as a result the group gets the grade - meaning everyone within the group gets that grade. One thing to note though is that it might be worthwhile in advance having a discussion about how you will as a group make final decisions and edits. Also, everyone in the group, when the final assignment is submitted, is agreeing with what is being submitted, so it is important that if you do not agree with something you discuss it with your group before submission.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-documents-state-a-minimum-requirement-in-terms-of-tests-but-can-we-do-more-than-that" class="section level3" number="1.0.6">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.6</span> The documents state a minimum requirement in terms of tests, but can we do more than that?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-documents-state-a-minimum-requirement-in-terms-of-tests-but-can-we-do-more-than-that"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In theory, if you are confident you can of course do more. But we would advise against it or, going even more tangential, doing an analytical approach we have not covered yet. Research is not about being complicated. It is about a simple study done well. More analyses or more complicated analyses tend to take more words and more space as you need to justify more decisions. Here we would advice sticking with just what is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-is-the-deadline-again-and-what-are-the-marking-criteria" class="section level3" number="1.0.7">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.7</span> When is the deadline again and what are the marking criteria?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when-is-the-deadline-again-and-what-are-the-marking-criteria"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Best to check the Assessment Information Sheet on Moodle. We believe it is better to have one document that has correct information rather than multiple documents having conflicting information so we will keep that answer to the Assessment Information Sheet.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-we-use-apa-citation-and-reference-format" class="section level3" number="1.0.8">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.8</span> Should we use APA citation and reference format?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-we-use-apa-citation-and-reference-format"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>For this assignment, all citations and references should follow APA guidelines although you do not need to indent the reference list or add italics (as you have not covered this yet); references should however be in alphabetical order by first author for example and not bullet pointed.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-write-sections-in-bullet-points" class="section level3" number="1.0.9">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.9</span> Can we write sections in bullet points?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-write-sections-in-bullet-points"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In short, no. One of the marking criteria on the Assessment Information Sheet states "Write clearly and succinctly with appropriate use of paragraphs, spelling and grammar." As such each section should be written clearly using paragraphs and sentences. It is ok to use bullet points when you are first sketching sections out, as placeholders or "thought holders", but the final submission should not have bullet points as the answers to the first five questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-do-we-just-write-our-responsesanswers-to-the-five-questions-in-the-rmd-file" class="section level3" number="1.0.10">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.10</span> So do we just write our responses/answers to the five questions in the Rmd file?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#so-do-we-just-write-our-responsesanswers-to-the-five-questions-in-the-rmd-file"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yep. Exactly. You should put your answer to each question in the space below each question. So it would look like:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Present a concise evidence-based rationale, for the current study, along with your research question and hypothesis.</li>
</ol>
<p>{your writing goes here}</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe the key variables, specifying how they will be measured, how many levels they have (if relevant), and how participants will be assigned (if relevant).</li>
</ol>
<p>{your writing goes here}</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-abbreviations" class="section level3" number="1.0.11">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.11</span> Can we use abbreviations?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-abbreviations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Abbreviations are really not great for readers - they are only good for writers in that it helps them save space. For a reader it creates a high cognitive demand as they try to remember what the abbreviation stood for, ultimately distracting them from reading and understanding what you are writing - an example here might be using SE for Self-Efficacy and IM for Intrinsic Motivation. Taking this approach makes the writing very hard to understand and we would discourage it at all times. The exception here is questionnaires (e.g. MSLQ) and well-known techniques or methods (e.g. MRI, MEG, EEG) but remember to state the phrase out in full in the first instance.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-use-quotations-from-previous-work" class="section level3" number="1.0.12">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.12</span> Can we use quotations from previous work?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-use-quotations-from-previous-work"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Technically this is allowed but would be better if you didn't and just rephrased the writing in your own words. For one, quotations change the tone of the writing from your tone to that of the other writer. More importantly, when you use a quotation, and don't go into depth about the meaning of that quotation, you are relying on the reader getting the exact same meaning from the quotation that you did but they are only getting the quotation out of context. A much better approach then is to restate the meaning so that it fits and flows with the surrounding context of your writing.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-we-use-do-not-or-dont" class="section level3" number="1.0.13">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.13</span> Should we use do not or don't?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-we-use-do-not-or-dont"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Do not use don't and other such shortenings like can't and shouldn't. Instead use do not etc. Remember academic tone!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-will-we-be-asked-to-submit-for-the-pre-registration" class="section level3" number="1.0.14">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.14</span> What will we be asked to submit for the Pre-Registration?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-will-we-be-asked-to-submit-for-the-pre-registration"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Full submission details will be made available on the submission page when we open it but part of the submission will include submitting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Your completed Pre-Registration .Rmd file</li>
<li>The knitted word document that comes out of your completed Pre-Registration .Rmd file</li>
<li>A copy of the pilot data used for the pre-registration code - just the .csv files again.</li>
<li>A group submission document - that basically has your group number, date, word count, GUIDs and a title</li>
</ol>
<p>We need the word document to supply feedback on what you have written and we need the code and pilot data to check that your code works. Please note that only one person should make the submission - the submission will automatically be attributed to everyone in that group.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-might-be-a-good-title-for-this-assignment" class="section level3" number="1.0.15">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.15</span> What might be a good title for this assignment?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-might-be-a-good-title-for-this-assignment"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A couple of examples might be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pre-registration analysis of the relationship between self-efficacy and test-anxiety.</li>
<li>A pre-registration analysis of the effect of level of study on test anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="can-we-still-work-on-the-coding-part-as-group-when-we-have-the-full-dataset" class="section level3" number="1.0.16">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.16</span> Can we still work on the coding part as group when we have the full dataset?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-still-work-on-the-coding-part-as-group-when-we-have-the-full-dataset"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yes. We believe in supporting each other so there is no issue here. For the final report we won't look at the code as part of the assessment, we only look at it when something is not clear - to help us understand better - and to just make you used to having others have access to your code. The code is only part of the Pre-Registration in terms of being assessed. The code is not part of the final full report assessment. As such you are more than welcome to continue to collaborate on the code together after the pre-registration if you find that helpful.</p>
</div>
<div id="when-will-we-get-the-full-dataset" class="section level3" number="1.0.17">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.17</span> When will we get the full dataset?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#when-will-we-get-the-full-dataset"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This would hopefully be two to three weeks after the submission of the Pre-Registration and around the time when all the feedback and grades are released. We need to hold off to allow people with extensions the time to submit as well and to keep the same learning environment of not having seen the full dataset before submitting the Pre-Registration. We will however be sure to let everyone know as soon as it is available.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-does-the-pilot-data-relate-to-the-full-data" class="section level3" number="1.0.18">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.0.18</span> How does the pilot data relate to the full data?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-does-the-pilot-data-relate-to-the-full-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The pilot data is basically the first few participants of the full data - the first 10 or 20 basically. The full data will look just like it but there will be a lot more participants including the pilot participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-big-is-the-full-dataset" class="section level3" number="1.0.19">

<span class="header-section-number">1.0.19</span> How big is the full dataset?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-big-is-the-full-dataset"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We are not entirely sure as we have been collecting data on this for 2 or 3 years now. We just give you everything we have up to the date that we make the full data available and it usually turns out to be a very large number of participants!</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-get-a-summary-of-the-data" class="section level3" number="1.0.20">

</h3>
<p>You will actually need to create this for the full report so we when you have the full data you can make any summary you like. If we give it to you prior to completing the pre-registration it will defeat the purpose of the pre-registration.</p>

</h3>
<p>With these assignments we are aiming to cover a variety of different elements - teaching research methods and statistics, teaching academic writing, teaching planning and design, giving some snapshot of what it is like to work with real data - but at the same time cater to the interests of a large diverse population (yourselves). The MSLQ study is nice in that it covers a range of topics and areas and it is something that we think you would all be interested in, to varying degrees, given that you have chosen to do this course - i.e. perhaps reflecting on your own reasoning might help generate questions and ideas for your discussions. There is also good research to suggest that working with real data in an area of interest is a good approach to making research methods accessible. Unfortunately we can't just have everyone run their own project as there is a lot of knowledge and skill to develop first, not to mention ethical considerations. Hopefully though by the end of the process you see the benefits of the approach we use and that the a lot of the knowledge and skill you get from this project you can take forward into future assignments and into future projects.</p>

<p>In reality the questionnaire was opened to predominantly in Level 1 (First year undergraduate class) and MSc labs, and students were asked to complete it as part of their course. Originally yhey could also send the invite to others meaning that we can’t guarantee that everyone was in the University of Glasgow. It was also left open on the main experiment page so others could do it as well.</p>
<p>In terms of when data collection started, there is a data-stamp on the datafiles that can indicate when first data was obtained but it is approximately early in 2020.</p>

</h3>
<p>Whilst full exemplars can have benefit, as any complete exemplar would be from the same assignment it would have risks of plagiarism and we do not want to set up bad practice. However over the semester we make available and discuss examples for the subsections and give many bits of advice: you can find those in the lab slides and materials on Moodle. Reviewing these next to the questions in the pre-registration to see the connections. In addition, the OSF has professional examples, which might help to look at and think about what they are presenting. You can view these by going to the registries section on the OSF to see some examples: <a href="https://osf.io/registries" target="_blank">https://osf.io/registries</a></p>
