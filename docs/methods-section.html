</h3>
<p>In general your Methods section will be mostly descriptive, just stating what you did, who you ran, and how, within the full report. Caveats to that may be things like your inclusion/exclusion criteria where you may wish to provide some justification, or perhaps you want to add a citation to support any discussion of using one approach over another, e.g. using the Welch's over the Students, but if just stating we used a Pearson correlation then there is no need for citation. Overall though the Methods section should be clear and concise.</p>

<p>There is these blogs at the end of the power chapter that might help: <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/power-and-effect-sizes.html#additional-information" target="_blank">https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/power-and-effect-sizes.html#additional-information</a> Your pre-reg is an estimate of how many people you needed. The full dataset is how many people you got. With that full dataset you can determine an effect of X. You run the analysis and find an effect of Y. If X is less than Y then your study was sufficiently powered. If X is bigger than Y then your study was underpowered. If your study is sufficiently powered and you find a significant effect then there is some support for it being a reliable effect. If your study is underpowered then no matter what you find, significant or not significant, is a bit unclear.</p>

<div id="do-we-need-subheadings-in-the-methods-section" class="section level3" number="9.0.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.3</span> Do we need subheadings in the Methods Section?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-subheadings-in-the-methods-section"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Yes. This is important as it is part of the APA formatting of a report and using the professional structure. The main subheadings would be Participants, Materials, Procedure, and Design and Data Analysis. Note however that sometimes the information in the Design and Data Analysis subsection could be included in the start of Results section instead. It comes down to what works best for your writing.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-change-the-order-of-subheadings-in-a-methods-section" class="section level3" number="9.0.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.4</span> Can we change the order of subheadings in a Methods Section?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-change-the-order-of-subheadings-in-a-methods-section"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The standard is usually Participants, Materials, Procedure, Design and Data Analysis, as this follows the logical flow of who, with what, and how - who did you test, what did you use, and what did they do, and how are you going to analyse it - however, if the information in your writing would make more sense in a different order then that would be acceptable. Do watch out however that logical flow is maintained in the order - do not try to explain things before the reader has the information they need to understand what you are talking about.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">9.0.5</span> Do we need an Ethics subsection in the Methods?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-an-ethics-subsection-in-the-methods"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>No but if you wanted to include one that is fine, or to include a sentence in the Procedure maybe. Please note that this is not essential for this report however. The study was granted ethics through the Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience within the College of Science and Engineering.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.6</span> What is the main difference between a Materials subsection and the Procedure subsection?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-main-difference-between-a-materials-subsection-and-the-procedure-subsection"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The main difference is that the Materials details what you used - stimuli, questionnaires, etc - whereas the Procedure details what participants did and how the study was run. For example, "The possible answers on each question was 1 to 5 with 1 meaning....." is Materials. Whereas, "Participants responded by using the mouse to select the appropriate button indicating...." is Procedure. Procedures for questionnaires aren't particularly long but there are some tips below to think about and a good thing to do is run yourself in the study again and think about some of the tips in that context.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-have-seen-cronbachs-alpha-mentioned-in-papers.-what-is-this-and-do-we-need-it" class="section level3" number="9.0.7">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.7</span> I have seen Cronbach's alpha mentioned in papers. What is this and do we need it?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#i-have-seen-cronbachs-alpha-mentioned-in-papers.-what-is-this-and-do-we-need-it"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In terms of a questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha measures a type of reliability known as internal consistency. Normally a Cronbach of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> &gt; .8 (so between .8 and 1) is considered very good reliability. When you create a questionnaire, you are trying to measure a type of behaviour across multiple questions. If the questionnaire measures one behaviour, then people should respond in a similar way to all the questions. Therefore, good internal consistency means people respond similarly to all the questions, but poor internal consistency means people respond less similar to all the questions and it may not be measuring one type of behaviour.</p>
<p>You do not need to calculate this for this report as we have not covered it. However you can include it if you like in the materials when talking about the MSLQ if you feel confident in it. Normally it is just a statement of "Previously this scale has been shown to have good internal consistency (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = .XX), (citation)". But this is not essential in this report as we have not covered it.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-we-need-to-discuss-the-code-we-wrote-and-how-it-worked" class="section level3" number="9.0.8">

</h3>
<p>No. Again not wrong but it is using up space and is really not needed and not the done thing in reports. If you find yourself saying "we loaded in the csv file and the filtered it for X and then mutated on a column before creating a mean value for each participant" then rephrase this as simply "a mean value was calculated for each participant" as that is the key bit. You do not need to detail how the code work and you are likely using up words that should be saved for other sections.</p>

<div id="when-we-calculated-power-for-the-t-test-in-the-pre-reg-we-were-expecting-equal-sizes.-how-can-i-calculate-the-power-with-unequal-sizes" class="section level3" number="9.0.9">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.9</span> When we calculated power for the t-test in the pre-reg we were expecting equal sizes.

</h3>
<p>There is also an example within the the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book here if that helps others: <a href="https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/power-and-effect-sizes.html#uneven-groups" target="_blank">https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/power-and-effect-sizes.html#uneven-groups</a>. Remember that you want to know the smallest <code>d</code> that you can determine with your sample sizes.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-the-participants-section-should-i-show-the-mean-age-and-sd-of-groups-regardless-of-whether-i-am-looking-at-age-or-not" class="section level3" number="9.0.10">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.10</span> In the participants section should I show the mean age and SD of groups regardless of whether I am looking at age or not?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#in-the-participants-section-should-i-show-the-mean-age-and-sd-of-groups-regardless-of-whether-i-am-looking-at-age-or-not"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It would be really recommended. In any research it is important that a reader can contextualise the sample - who were they? There is a big difference between a sample of 60 year olds and a sample of 18 year olds and if you don't tell your reader who was tested then they can never contextualise the results. Most commonly you will see a breakdown of the number of participants and the mean age and standard deviation of age for categorical variable of interest - e.g. Mature Students (N = ..., Mean Age = ..., SD = ....). You may see other information such as nationality but that additional information is more important when it is relevant and not just standard practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-i-give-the-total-n-and-mean-age-etc-on-the-sample-before-exclusions-after-exclusions-or-both" class="section level3" number="9.0.11">

<span class="header-section-number">9.0.11</span> Should I give the total N and Mean Age etc on the sample before exclusions, after exclusions, or both?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-i-give-the-total-n-and-mean-age-etc-on-the-sample-before-exclusions-after-exclusions-or-both"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most important one is after exclusions because that is who will ultimately be tested upon. It might be interesting to include information prior to exclusion - as it can sometimes show issues - but that might come down to availability of words. Main thing to think about is what is relevant and to not go into too much detail of what is not relevant using up words.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-wanted-to-show-a-mean-age-but-some-didnt-give-their-age-and-i-dont-want-to-filter-them-out" class="section level3" number="9.0.12">

</h3>
<p>In that situation we might do something like "150 participants took part in our study (Mean Age = ..... years, SD = ......; 45 declined to answer)......." At least that way you are making it clear the age and sd are based on what you have and you are making it clear that X didn't answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-year-and-how-was-the-data-from-the-mslq-collected-1" class="section level3" number="9.0.13">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.13</span> What year and how was the data from the MSLQ collected?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-year-and-how-was-the-data-from-the-mslq-collected-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In reality it was used predominantly in Level 1 (First year undergraduate class) and MSc labs, and students were asked to complete it as part of their course. They could also send the invite to others meaning that we can't guarantee that everyone was in the University of Glasgow. It was also left open on the main experiment page so others could do it as well. In terms of when it started, there is a datastamp on the datafiles that can indicate when first data was obtained.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-we-need-citations-in-our-methods-section" class="section level3" number="9.0.14">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.14</span> Do we need citations in our methods section?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-citations-in-our-methods-section"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>You would definitely need to cite the MSLQ and Experimentum as these are something someone has created and made available. Beyond that it comes down to the argument being made. More often than not a Methods section is light on citations. Only when you are making an argument for doing something - like not using the Shapiro-Wilks after you said you would use it - or doing something different from the standard - opted to use Kendall's Tau instead of Pearson and/or Spearman for reason X, Y and Z - would you use a citation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.15</span> Do we need to define all terminology, e.g., between-subjects?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-to-define-all-terminology-e.g.-between-subjects"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>No, you can assume a basic level of methodological understanding on behalf of the reader. You should however define your variables in the introduction, for example, what exactly do you mean by test anxiety, what is the official criteria for a “mature” student etc.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.0.16</span> Do we need a citation for stating <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> levels?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-we-need-a-citation-for-stating-alpha-and-beta-levels"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>No, as long as you are using the field standards of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .05\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = .8\)</span>. There you would just say "using the field standards of..." You can of course include a citation if you have one but it isn't really needed. That said, however, if you decide to use values different from the field standards, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = .01\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta = .95\)</span> then you will want to briefly state why and give a citation or two to support this.</p>
