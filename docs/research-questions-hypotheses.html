</h3>
<p>A research question is really just the overarching question to your study, what you want to know, whereas the hypothesis is a clear, testable, falsifiable, operationalised statement about what you think will happen in the study. For example, "Is there a relationship between intrinsic motivation and engagement with peer assisted learning in a student population?" is a research question, whereas "We hypothesise that there will be a significant positive relationship between between intrinsic motivation and engagement with peer assisted learning in a student population, as measured through the MSLQ" is a hypothesis. The research question can't be falsified as it is unclear as to what constitute a relationship and there is no indication in terms of how the terms are measured. The hypothesis however can be tested and can be falsified - in that there will either be a significant positive relationship or not - and it is operationalised by saying that the variables are measured through the MSLQ.</p>

</h3>
<p>No. But it helps. Very roughly, the brain works on schemas and primers - or it can do at least. It is why signs are so effective. So when it comes to stating your hypothesis, stating "we hypothesise....." is a clear sign to your reader that this is the hypothesis. You can use other words of course but if a sign works then why change it? If you use an unclear sign to your hypothesis then your reader might not clearly spot your hypothesis and this will make the reading harder for them.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.0.3</span> How many hypotheses should we have?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-many-hypotheses-should-we-have"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A rough statement is that, assuming you are confirming a previous idea, there should be a clear hypothesis for each inferential test that you will run. So if your paper runs one correlation then one hypothesis. If your paper runs one t-test then one hypothesis. And a paper that runs three t-tests, two correlations, etc should have a matching number of hypotheses. We would not encourage such a complicated study!</p>
</div>
<div id="we-were-going-to-run-two-correlations-so-should-we-have-two-hypotheses" class="section level3" number="2.0.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.0.4</span> We were going to run two correlations so should we have two hypotheses?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#we-were-going-to-run-two-correlations-so-should-we-have-two-hypotheses"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>First we would ask you if you really need to run two correlations here. If it is about showing complexity then don't. If it is about answering a specific research question then read on.</p>
<p>In this situation there would likely be two hypotheses and we would encourage you, when writing your hypotheses, to see them and write them as two separate hypotheses. "We hypothesise that there will be a relationship....... Secondly, we hypothesise that there will be a relationship......". Writing like this will help you keep on track of things - particularly thinking forward to when you write the Results of the full study later in the semester. In the Results section, after running the inferential test/s, you have to say whether you accept or reject (or retain) the hypothesis of the test you are running. If you have two hypotheses then it is easier on your head because you just look at each one and say "ok I accept that one but I reject that one" or whatever the case may be. If however you have the hypotheses as one sentence and you start seeing it as one hypothesis, if you get a significant correlation and a non-significant correlation, for example, you may get confused and start giving an awkward outcome of "well we sort of accept that part but not that part so we partially accept". But there isn't really a method of partially accepting a hypothesis and probably means the hypothesis was badly worded to begin with. So long story short, two sentences is potentially better than one. But if you use one sentence, make it clear to yourself and your reader, that it is two tests and two hypotheses.</p>

</h3>
<p>This depends on your writing. In reality there is no one-to-one mapping of research question to analytical test and as such you could have one research question that covers a number of tests - "is there a relationship between X and Y, and is this affected by whether participants A or B" - or you could have a specific research question that fits specifically with one individual hypothesis. Here, in this assignment, we would encourage one research question and one hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-meant-by-rationalejustification-of-a-study" class="section level3" number="2.0.6">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.0.6</span> What is meant by rationale/justification of a study?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-meant-by-rationalejustification-of-a-study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In short, this can be answered as "why bother doing this?" or "what do we learn from this study?". The justification/rationale is really based on your reading of previous literature and often it is driven by you spotting a gap in the research, an unanswered question, some debate in outcomes, or even just replicating a previous study as replication is the bedrock of science and previous research had issues of methods or approach. For example, for a period of time voice research on societal biases focused a lot on just male voices and little was known about female voices. Rationale for carrying out research into female voices then could be justified as how females are impacted by societal biases based on their voice is unknown and by knowing that we can start to address issues face by females. Alternatively, voice research uses two approaches for obtaining responses in research - a rating scale and a forced choice task - however it has been noted in findings that the two approaches give different and opposing findings so doing a test to specifically compare the results from these approaches is beneficial because then we know which data is best to use. So there are lots of rationale/justification for carrying out studies and these are just a couple of examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-would-be-a-poor-rationale-for-a-study" class="section level3" number="2.0.7">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.0.7</span> What would be a poor rationale for a study?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-would-be-a-poor-rationale-for-a-study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A poor rationale would be one that is not based on previous research or the link to previous research is unclear or when there is no clear justification stated. For example, let's say that all previous research on test anxiety is carried out in undergraduate students. You spot this, point this out in your writing and decide to do a study that compares postgraduates and undergraduates but don't state why. That would be weak justification because you haven't given any reason as to why test postgraduates. Even if it is just to find out if test anxiety replicates in postgraduates then that would be better than stating nothing. Even better would be to go deeper and think about, and state, what it would mean if test anxiety does replicate in postgraduates (e.g. measures are needed at all levels for additional support) or doesn't replicate (e.g. something about age and experience helps reduce test anxiety). In short though, the better rationales are the ones that clearly show the point of the research and what we learn from it in terms of understanding how things work.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-we-have-a-directional-or-non-directional-hypothesis" class="section level3" number="2.0.8">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.0.8</span> Should we have a directional or non-directional hypothesis?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-we-have-a-directional-or-non-directional-hypothesis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In reality you can have either but it probably makes sense to see if you can go with a directional hypothesis based on what your review of the previous research is suggesting. For example, if previous research suggests that there is going to be an effect and it will be in a specific direction (e.g. positive correlation) then it makes sense to hypothesise a positive correlation. If previous research suggests a negative correlation then it would make sense to hypothesise a negative correlation. If however, previous research is a bit uncertain with some findings suggesting a positive relationship and some suggesting a negative relationship, you could perhaps suggest a non-directional hypothesis.</p>

</h3>
<p>Really up to you and your group what works best for your question and your writing. The one thing we would say is that if you go with two paragraphs then remember the should flow together and should be linked, as they are all part of the same pre-registration and not completely different sections - meaning that you don't have to repeat yourself and you probably want to think about the linking sentence at the start of the second paragraph to keep the flow of the writing going. This blog is nice on writing paragraphs: <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/how-to-write-paragraphs-in-research-texts-articles-books-and-phds/" class="uri">https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/how-to-write-paragraphs-in-research-texts-articles-books-and-phds/</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.0.10</span> If we spot an issue with our Pre-Registration after submitting it and then change it, would that be HARKing?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#if-we-spot-an-issue-with-our-pre-registration-after-submitting-it-and-then-change-it-would-that-be-harking"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>HARKing is literally "hypothesising after the results are known"; meaning that you run an analysis on your data, look at that output, and then write the introduction and the hypothesis as though that was what you predicted all along. If however you write a Pre-Registration and then after that you do more reading and/ or new literature comes out before you actually complete your own study or analysis and based on new information you decide to change your Research Question or hypothesis slightly, you aren't actually doing anything wrong and in fact it would make sense to base your hypothesis on all available information. It would however still be ethically advisable to acknowledge that fact, i.e. somewhere in your report you would mention that you initially hypothesized X but after further review of the literature you amended your hypothesis to Y. This way you are being open and transparent. So long story short, changing your hypothesis based on further reading but BEFORE running an analysis or even looking at your data is completely fine. However, changing your hypothesis based on what you found in your analysis to make it look like that is what you predicted in the first place is definitely HARKing and should not be carried out.</p>
