</h3>
<p>The purpose of an Introduction is to provide a rationale for the study that you are going to conduct. It will contain elements of a literature review because you will discuss previous work as part of building this rationale, however, you also need to try and identify and highlight the reason why you conducted the study you did so you will not need every detail of every previous research. A literature review generally tells a much larger fuller story of a field; an Introduction is only part of the story of that field.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">8.0.2</span> What is the best way to structure our introduction?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-best-way-to-structure-our-introduction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most common advice is to run broad to narrow and that holds here as well. The tricky part is that you are working with probably two variables and trying to bring that altogether. Obviously there are a million different ways to bring all this information together but if it was us we would default to the notion of no, matter what we do, the hypothesis is always in the last paragraph of the introduction. Where the Research Question sits in the Introduction can vary - some put it near the start to give the reader an early insight; others leave it until much later on as the writing can flow better that way. But the introduction to the methods transition works best when the hypothesis is at the end of the introduction.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-we-give-equal-weight-to-all-the-variables-in-the-introduction" class="section level3" number="8.0.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.3</span> Should we give equal weight to all the variables in the introduction?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#should-we-give-equal-weight-to-all-the-variables-in-the-introduction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>That is one option and that can work if you are equally interested in all variables and each are as equally important to what you are overall trying to show. Alternatively, it might be that one of the variables takes more of the focus in the introduction - perhaps what you are testing has not been shown and one of the variables has had little research on it. However, when there are only two variables there is probably going to be more of an equal balance but doesn't have to be exactly equal. The main thing to try and avoid is that one variable is covered in great depth and the second is just briefly mentioned - that won't create a good rationale for the study.</p>
</div>

<span class="header-section-number">8.0.4</span> Can I change my hypothesis?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-i-change-my-hypothesis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In practice, what you would probably do here if running your own full project would depend on whether you had run the analysis or not. As soon as you run the analysis you should always write up what you originally intended and just deal with any differences in the discussion. If you haven't run the analysis you can effectively scrap everything and run a new pre-reg. But yeah, the point of no return, if you like, is running the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-i-say-my-study-is-a-replication" class="section level3" number="8.0.5">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.5</span> Can I say my study is a replication?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-i-say-my-study-is-a-replication"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There is a distinction between direct and conceptual replication. With direct replication you are pretty much doing the exact same test as the original paper. With a conceptual replication it is a bit vaguer - that would be more close to such and such was found to hold in X, and if that reasoning and theory is correct then the same effect should be seen in Y. So that can be stated. However, when a direct replication becomes a conceptual replication, and when a conceptual replication becomes just a whole new study inspired by something previous is really not clearly defined. Long story short, here you might think of this work as a conceptual replication but it might not be a direct replication given that the sample is likely to change. If you want to read into the distinction between conceptual and direct replications, we recommend <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113001819">Brandt et al. (2014)</a> who provide a checklist of what makes a convincing replication.</p>
</div>
<div id="should-the-full-report-have-the-same-hypothesis-as-the-pre-registration" class="section level3" number="8.0.6">

</h3>
<p>If the question is should the full report have the same hypothesis as was stated in the pre-registration then the answer would be most likely. You can deviate or change of course but be sure to do that before you look at the data and definitely not after. At this stage it can be better to just go with the hypothesis you had though and deal with differences in the Discussion.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-it-an-issue-if-the-results-are-opposite-to-the-hypothesis-we-stated---e.g.-we-hypothesised-a-negative-correlation-but-it-turned-out-to-be-positive" class="section level3" number="8.0.7">

<span class="header-section-number">8.0.7</span> Is it an issue if the results are opposite to the hypothesis we stated - e.g. we hypothesised a negative correlation but it turned out to be positive?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-it-an-issue-if-the-results-are-opposite-to-the-hypothesis-we-stated---e.g.-we-hypothesised-a-negative-correlation-but-it-turned-out-to-be-positive"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This is not an issue and can make for a really interesting discussion. You have found something different from previous studies, assuming you based the hypothesis on previous studies, so you can now think about and discuss why that difference exists. Avoid assuming it is because you have done something wrong or the study was flawed - look for differences that might potentially explain the difference and perhaps build future directions from that. That said, if there were limitations that may have raised an issue then perhaps discuss them as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-change-the-rationale-for-our-effect-size-or-other-aspects-of-what-we-have-proposed-and-how-might-we-do-this-without-sounding-clunky" class="section level3" number="8.0.8">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.8</span> Can we change the rationale for our effect size or other aspects of what we have proposed? And how might we do this without sounding clunky?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-we-change-the-rationale-for-our-effect-size-or-other-aspects-of-what-we-have-proposed-and-how-might-we-do-this-without-sounding-clunky"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Again this assumes you haven't run the analysis first but there is nothing wrong in saying “Originally we had planned for ….. based on research into……..(citation). However, on reflection, and based on ………(citation) it would be more appropriate to estimate an effect size…….” That is totally fine and totally honest and would be something we would write. Really not about trying to catch people out in research and more just asking people to state what they are doing and why. However, if you have run the analysis then just deal with any issues and differences in the Discussion and don't go back and change part of the analysis to get a better/different finding.</p>
<p>Please note that this is different however from saying "we had planned an effect size of X and that required N participants. We ended up with N+100 participants and so ran the power analysis again to determine the smallest effect size our design could find". This is completely fine and most likely what a lot of people will do here.</p>

<div id="my-results-werent-significant-am-i-going-to-fail" class="section level3" number="8.0.9">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.9</span> My results weren't significant, am I going to fail?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#my-results-werent-significant-am-i-going-to-fail"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>No. This is never about finding a significant result. It is purely about writing up research regardless of the outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-we-need-to-stick-to-a-rigid-discussion-format-of-summarise-all-findings-first-then-theory" class="section level3" number="8.0.10">

</h3>
<p>The common approach would summarise all findings first and then deal with each in turn but that doesn't mean that an alterantive can't work. We think it might save words by taking the standard approach of all findings summarised and then each in turn related to theory and previous work, but that is just a guess and it may be marginal. But yeah, but both options could/would work. Of course, most of you will only have one finding in this study so summarising it and then discussing it in terms of research and theory is the best approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-am-not-sure-what-details-of-previous-research-to-focus-on-in-the-introduction.-any-suggestions" class="section level3" number="8.0.11">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.11</span> I am not sure what details of previous research to focus on in the Introduction. Any suggestions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#i-am-not-sure-what-details-of-previous-research-to-focus-on-in-the-introduction.-any-suggestions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Actually this is likely to change depending on where you are in the Introduction. Look for this the next time you are reading a paper. Towards the start of the introduction you tend to see a much more global summary of the findings of papers and there is not much detail about what happened. Here people are setting the background broadly. As the Introduction progresses you tend to see more and more detail being mentioned about previous studies. Not all the individual details are mentioned however. What is mentioned is a) what is relevant to the current study, and b) what might help with discussion. So what is relevant might be the main overall finding, and what adds to the discussion might be how it was done, on who, and where, and how big was the effect. Say for instance, the rationale for your study is that it has never been tested in postgrads. In your introduction you will want to make it clear that the previous research was in undergrads or school children. For example, "Paterson et al. (2015), testing children between the ages of 10 and 15, found that...." So here we are giving the finding, but we are also giving detail that will help make our rationale more salient when we state it. Also, it gives us room for discussion in the Discussion section. Say you are doing a close replication of a finding but in the end your results are completely different to what was previously found. If you have given some detail as to the previous study - who and how - then you give yourself more room for comparison, as to why there was a difference, later on in your discussion. So to go back to the question, as you go further through the Introduction you tend to pull out more detail but you only need to mention the detail that is relevant to what is being tested.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-we-have-space-can-we-not-just-state-all-the-details-of-previous-research" class="section level3" number="8.0.12">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">8.0.12</span> If we have space can we not just state all the details of previous research?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#if-we-have-space-can-we-not-just-state-all-the-details-of-previous-research"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Firstly, if you find you have the space to do that then you are probably not covering enough previous research. Secondly, think about the reader and trying to give them pointers as to what is to come. Compare these two sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paterson et al. (2015), in children aged 10-15, found.....</li>
<li>Paterson et al. (2015), in Glaswegian right-handed children aged 10-15 using a 9-point Likert scale tested online on a Friday, found.....</li>
</ul>
<p>If the rationale is just about age then the first sentence hits that point clearly without confusing the reader. In contrast, the second sentence makes the reader think they have to hold all this information, only to later find out that the key info was age and the rest isn't really being tested here. So details are interesting but not always relevant. Maybe all the detail is relevant to your study but, if it isn't, you might just be confusing your reader.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-it-matter-the-order-in-which-i-present-research-in-my-introduction." class="section level3" number="8.0.13">

<span class="header-section-number">8.0.13</span> Does it matter the order in which I present research in my introduction.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#does-it-matter-the-order-in-which-i-present-research-in-my-introduction."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It used to be that people tried to present the research in order of most relevance to their own study so that the most relevant, and most detailed, was mentioned just before they moved into the last paragraph where they focussed on "In the current study...". This can be a good approach as it fits nicely with the Broad to Narrow idea; you are leading the reader through the introduction and building up their knowledge as you go. This should give a nice logical flow, so that when it gets to the hypothesis and rationale for the current study, it is really clear to the reader.</p>
