# Section Tips

Now follows a series of tips that are not meant to be exhaustive but might help in a sort of checklist fashion to cover some of the aspects we have talked about. Please remember that the slides and videos of each section are the main source and this is just a summary. Also, keep in mind that this is your first attempt at a full report - we do not expect you to have mastered all of the below but this shows you many of the things we have mentioned in the videos and on the channels and that we are working with you towards mastering over your time with us. That said, after writing a section, going through this list for that section may help improve that section, ironing out a few issues, so that you can do as well as you can. Please do not be put off by this list and more see it, as mentioned, as a sort of checklist of sorts. 

# Title

* Is not included in the word count.
* A clear statement as to what your study is looking at works best.
* Something like "The relationship between X and Y" or "The effect of X on Y" is fine at this stage depending on what analysis you did.
* That said a title that states the main findings can be really effective "Postgraduates show greater self-reported test anxiety than undergraduates."
* Titles should have enough info to know what the report is about. Make it clear and understandable; not complicated; avoid jargon
* About 20 words is probably more than enough for a title. Keep it short but meaningful.
* Try to avoid catchy and clickbait titles with multiple clauses - even though yes we have written them in the past (we were young and foolish). This is an interesting article that shows that amusing titles get less citations: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551507086261](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551507086261){target="_blank"}.
*	Titles that state No effect (or no relationship) found between ... are acceptable

# Table of Contents

* Do not have one!
* Ever!
* If you find you have accidentally put one in, make sure you deliberately delete it.
* No table of contents

# Abstract

* Is included in the word count and should be roughly 250 words.
* The abstract is on a page of its own and usually written as one paragraph.
* Starts with the heading of "Abstract" centred and in bold.
* The abstract is a summary of the entire research report. It is the first part of a report and the first thing that people will read; however, you should write the abstract last after you have finished all sections of the report.
* Start off with the Area and the Aim. This is a brief snapshot of what has come before and perhaps what is not yet know. This might lead into your Research Question and/or Hypotheses.
* Methods comes next. Who were the participants and what did they do.
* Next is a brief description of Results
  * Usually mentions the type of analysis - pearson correlation, etc.
  * It is not essential to include statistics and values, often you see results termed just as significant or not and a verbal description of the size of the effect.
* The abstract ends on Discussion, Interpretation and/or Conclusion. What do your findings say about the original aim of your study mentioned at the start of the Abstract. This discussion is concise and leaves the reader wanting to find out more details about the research.
*	Avoid finishing on bland statements such as "Future studies will be presented and the results will be discussed". This is just telling us what a Discussion is meant to do and not what you discussed.
*	Try to end on a strong statement of discussion related to theory
* Try to avoid ending on "The limitations of our study are discussed in great length" or words to that effect. Remember the abstract is the first thing people read after the title so you don't want to destroy your paper before someone even reads the Introduction.
*	No need to include citations in your abstract but this is not a hard and fast rule. Statements such as "Previous research has shown......." does not need a citation necessarily in the abstract but it would everywhere else.
* Keywords are not needed in this report.

# Introduction

*	Starts on a new page after the abstract - i.e. take a new page after the abstract and start the introduction at the top of that new page.
*	No need to rewrite the title at top of introduction as it is on the title page.
* Can include a heading of "Introduction" centred and in bold if it helps but not required in APA formatting and introduction can start on first line of page.
* The purpose of a research report introduction is to provide background research and justification for the current study
*	Most common approach is the triangular structure, from broad (the reason for why this is work is interesting) to focussed on the research question and hypothesis (the current study).
*	How broad should you be at the start? "Psychology is interesting..." is too broad. Starting general on how we understand learning is fine but can be even more focused and start on the importance of one of your variables - e.g. Self-efficacy is the.....
*	A good approach is each paragraph contains one key point and points flow logically from one to the next in building the rationale. Point, Explain, Evaluate, Link is a good approach for a paragraph and try to avoid having too many points per paragraph or splitting one point across numerous paragraphs - see "how to write a paragraph" blog above for ideas.
*	Avoid dumping all the information you know into the first paragraph. This is a good way to get things out of your head and onto paper but it is not good for the reader - redraft, redraft, redraft.
*	Make sure to link and connect sentences within a paragraph. It is not just series of facts. Have a look at the critical evaluation example above.
*	All research should have an appropriate citation in the text (APA format) and a full reference in the reference section.
*	Remember to compare, contrast, link, and evaluate research and draw out the key points for your reader so that any variables highlighted in the Current Study paragraph are not coming from nowhere. Have a look at the critical evaluation example above.
* It can help to point out any gaps in previous research, knowledge, or to point to methodological issues, or just a need to replicate findings. This is best done with citations and support.
* The amount of detail you give regarding previous studies you discuss is based on what is relevant - you do not need to discuss every single point or mention every single detail. Instead focus on the points that are relevant for building your rationale, justification and arguments. If it is not relevant that the previous study was conducted in the UK then do you need to tell the reader this? However if you want to make a point about culture either as the main study or in the discussion, this might be relevant. 
*	Often subheadings are used to bypass linking arguments and paragraphs. They are allowed but more often than not the Introduction will be better if you link the paragraphs yourself so try to not use them if you can. But again, not wrong to use them. 
*	Remember that all subheadings count in the word count.
* It can help to structure the introduction around one of your variables and make that the key focus of the paper. Key variable could be, for example, either one of the continuous variables of the correlation or the categorical variable of the t-test.
*	Possible five paragraph structure - introduction on general area and key variable, more focused info on key variable, info on second variable, theory underlying ideas, current study paragraph (including research questions and hypotheses)
* Define key terms and concepts, e.g., test anxiety, mature vs traditional students. This can be at the start or somewhere more better positioned to avoid making that first paragraph a list of definitions. Remember citations though.
*	Current study paragraph at the end of introduction can introduce or reiterate the research question if not mentioned before, and usually restates the justification, and ends on hypothesis.
* You must remember to state the hypothesis.
*	Remember the whole point of the introduction is to build to the justification of the (Research Question) RQ and a strong clear hypothesis so try to maintain logical flow by ending on hypothesis after showing all the relevant information first.
* Avoid using bullet points for your hypothesis and, in fact, avoid using bullet points anywhere in the report.
* Avoid numbering hypotheses as H1, H2, etc if you have more than one. It is ok to talk about them though in the terms of the first hypothesis and the second hypothesis.
*	It can really help to make use of schemas and start the final paragraph with "The current study....."  and to state the hypothesis as "We hypothesise...."
*	When writing the hypothesis, watch out for using words that may suggest a different analysis than the one you plan. Again think of it like a schema you have of a restaurant or a situation. Words prime people to expect certain outcomes, so in terms of clarity avoid causing any confusion in your reader. Saying a "significant difference" fits with a t-test and comparison of groups. Saying a "significant relationship" fits with a correlation.
*	The hypothesis can be directional, non-directional, or null (though best avoiding null), and it makes most sense to the reader when it fits with the research introduced in the introduction. If all previous research you mention suggests a positive effect and you predict a negative effect that might be a bit odd.
*	Try to introduce some theory into your introduction. When you have written a full introduction go back through it and look to see if you are discussing and evaluating an underlying theory. If not, think about if you can suggest something and even give it support through citation. Theory is why some result may occur. For example, that ratings of aggression in faces are consistent whether the faces are shown for 100ms or for 500msecs is the finding of a study. That humans may generate impressions as a survival mechanism, allowing for rapid determination of whether to evoke approach or avoidance behavior, is the theory. Compare previous literature in terms of the outcome of the studies (the results) and try to highlight the underlying theory of your research. 
* Of course sometimes there is no theory and that is ok but maybe give a tentative suggestion as to why things might happen.
*	And again think of schemas and how that helps the reader when talking about theory. Just as with the "We hypothesise...." idea, writing "One theory underpinning this research......"  can help you remember to include writing about theory and can help the reader see where you are.
* You can use either the active voice or the passive voice. Neither is considered the only way though some argue the active voice is easier for a reader to follow and uses less words. Most writing guides on the internet talk about this distinction but this one suggested is worth a read: [Active vs Passive voice](https://cgi.duke.edu/web/sciwriting/index.php?action=passive_voice){target="_blank"}
*	Avoid rhetorical questions throughout!! Why? Seriously????? Who are you asking!!!

# Methods

* Does not start on a new page after the end of the Introduction. It starts just after the Introduction.
* Starts with the word "Methods" centered and in bold.
* Method sections are very formulaic, and really about stating the detail. Be concise - i.e. there is not a lot of discussion - but be detailed.
* You do not need to present all the information and arguments from the pre-registration again here unless it is relevant to what you want to say.
* Should not contain any bullet points and should be written in paragraphs just like any other section.
* Must use subheadings within the Methods. The most common ones for this report are Participants, Materials, Procedure, Design and Data Analysis. These subheadings are in bold and left-aligned on the page. Not centered.
* Participants:
  * Remember to include all relevant demographic details such as total N, subgroup Ns, mean age, sd age, gender split, and any other relevant information.
  * Discuss method of recruitment - perhaps opportunity/convenience sampling primarily with advertising on social media
  * Present relevant exclusion and inclusion criteria for participants in the study. But remember to keep a logical flow in that it may make sense to present exclusions before or after demographics depending on writing.
  * Sometimes you will see the power analysis in the Participants section as you know the sample numbers but this can also appear in later sections.
  * Can be useful to mention if participants were paid or took part for some incentive.
* Materials:
  * Main aspect here is describing the questionnaires - demographics and MSLQ
  * Think about stating example questions, total number of questions, how many questions people responded to, what was the responses available, and perhaps an example of a question or two.
  * You can state about reliability of the MSLQ or sub-scales if you like (e.g. cronbach alpha) but not required in this report.
  * Try to give a general overview of the MSLQ and then a bit more specific view of the sub-scales and categorical variables you will specifically use.
  * Most likely you will also mention Experimentum in this section.
  * Both the MSLQ and Experimentum should have citations and corresponding references.
  * DeBruine, L., Lai, R., Jones, B., Abdullah, R., & Mahrholz, G. (2020). Experimentum (Version v.0.2). Zenodo. doi:10.5281/ zenodo.2634355
  * Example questions from the questionnaire are usually shown in quotation marks as it is indicating a specific question. Subscales from the questionnaire and the questionnaire name itself are not usually shown in quotations.
  * There is an example of a write-up of a questionnaire in the slides from the presentation by Phil on writing Methods sections.
* Procedure:
  * Upon reading your procedure a fellow researcher should be able to copy exactly what you did. This doesn't necessarily mean in terms of consents and debriefs, but those can be mentioned briefly ("After completing ...." and "participants were debriefed and thanked for participation"), but really means what a participant saw and/or die when taking part in your study.
  * What did participants do? What order did they do it in? Were the questions randomised? Were the questions blocked in some fashion (e.g. all of one subscale then the next, using the original specific order, or some new order)? Were the questions all shown on the one screen or individually? How did participants respond (e.g. mouse click, button click, verbally)?
  * Were participants given a time limit to respond? Were participants given any breaks or just told to complete it in a comfortable pace?
  * It is always good practice to state roughly how long your study took. This doesn't have to be exact but can be estimated from how long it took you to complete the study including answering all questions plus a few minutes for information forms and consent forms to be read, plus any breaks.
  * If you find yourself repeating information from the Materials then it might mean something is in the wrong section. Ask yourself is this about what a participant did or something about the questionnaire.
  * There is an example of a write-up of a Procedure in slides of the presentation given by Phil on writing a Methods section.
* Design and Data Analysis
  * This section gives a brief overview of the design of your study and how you are planning on analysing the data.
  * Here you should be looking to state the design (correlational, between-subjects, etc) of your study.
  * You should state the variables for the design as well - remembering to determine for the test which is the dependent variable and which is the independent variable if you are running a t-test. If it is a correlation then they are both just stated as variables.
  * When talking about the variables aim to be specific, e.g. mean test anxiety as opposed to just test anxiety.
  * It is perfectly fine to say the Independent Variable is X with the two conditions of A and B - or you can find a way of saying it that doesn't use the words Independent and Dependent Variable if you like but it should be clear from the writing which is which, and how many groups are in the IV and what they are.
  * Another word for conditions/groups of an IV is levels so you might see that word from time to time. Feel free to use it as well. A between-subjects test is conducted on an independent variable with two levels.
  * In terms of data analysis you can state intent to use Pearson or Welch's between-subjects t-test here. You can also present assumption checks, outlier checks, and additional exclusion criteria here or present them in the Results section if more fitting.
  * You can present information on the power analysis here if you have not already mentioned it.

# Results

* Results section starts just after the Methods and does not take a new page.
* It starts with the word "Results" bold and centered.
* A good structure to presenting each study is Hypothesis, Deviations from Pre-Registration, Assumption Checks, Descriptives, Inferentials and then stating whether the hypothesis was supported or not and perhaps a brief statement of interpretation.
* When you have more than one analysis it is best to do one whole analysis and then the next and not mixing the two together. The vast majority will only have one analysis however so expect the Results section to be short and to the point.
*	No need for subheadings in a Results sectino but can be used if it would improve the clarity of the writing. For example, "Study 1" and "Study 2" would be fine. We would avoid subheadings of "descriptives", "inferentials" etc. 
* With Results sections sometimes it is better to write long-format first (i.e. very long and verbose) and then redraft it to shorten it.
* All the parts of the results can be written in one or two paragraphs. This looks better than 5 or 6 small one sentence paragraphs.
* When stating the hypothesis, make sure to match it to the one in the introduction. It should not have changed when writing the Methods.
* When talking about assumptions, make sure that you avoid just stating what the assumptions are and instead state that they were checked and verified, or checked and found to hold, or if they didn't hold, what are you doing about it and what change are you making to your analysis.
* Remember to state how you checked the assumptions - visualisations etc. You do not show these in the Results but need to explain that is what you did. If you ran a Shapiro-Wilks and are basing a decision off of that then you would show the output (W = ...., p = ....)
* Just to clarify, it is not wrong to show all the histograms and assumption checks but it is not advised because a) at one level you have to trust the researcher and their writing, and b) each figure requires a figure legend and discussion taking up a lot of space and words and will likely be missing stuff from the Introduction or Discussion.
* If assumptions are not met, you say this and also how you resolved it.  For instance, a single outlier was observed on visual inspection and was removed/replaced, etc; or data was highly skewed and as such analysis was conducted using non-parametric tests.
* When presenting Descriptives, be sure to interpret the relationship/difference. This is a subjective evaluation but should be more than just "Group A was this and Group B was this". Think of it in terms of "Group A appears to have a larger...."
* Aim to present values using APA formatting including, and especially, whitespace, e.g. M = 12.25 years and not M=12.25
* Commonly if the value can go above 1 then we use two decimal places. If the value can't go above 1 then we use three decimal places. If unsure, try to be consistent at least and avoid using more than three decimal places.
* You can present values in a table if it helps but remember to discuss the relationship/difference regardless of whether the values are in the text or in a table. "Group A had a larger.... (M = x.xx, SD = y.yy)" is fine, as is "Group A had a larger .... (see Table 1)". Main point is that the tables and figures are referred to and interpreted and the reader is not just left to figure it out.
* Each analysis usually has one figure. As you are running a t-test or a correlation you would likely have one figure in the report.
*	Put your key figure in the Results section and not in the appendices.
* Just like with tables, refer to your figure in the text (see Figure 1) - interpret and evaluate it in the text, "It would appear that..."
* We have not covered making figures in APA format yet but you are more than welcome to try but it is not required.
  * if you want to work towards APA - again not required for figures - then think about showing the full scale on your axes and correctly labeling the axes, and see the above point on using `theme_classic()`
* Remember to give a title to tables and figures and to include any notes/legends for the figure. These count as words so keep them short but informative. What does the figure show? What do the dots represent? Try to also think about the figure if it wasn't shown in color - it can help to state something like, "mature students (blue, left) and traditional students (green, right)."  It can also help to indicate on correlation plots or boxplots that show individual data points, what individual data point represents. "Each point shows an individual participant." * Tables and figures count in the word count. You do need at least one figure in the Results section; tables can be used if you like.
* Be precise on the APA formatting of the inferential test outputs.
* t-test outputs are nearly always presented in the text and never in a table. Correlation outputs, when there is only one or two correlations, are also normally presented in the text. When you have multiple correlations then you might want to present them in a table.
*	Give exact p-values, e.g. p = .013.(unless smaller than .001, e.g. p < .001), if non-significant, still give the exact p-value.
*	Do not state p-value in scientific format, i.e. p < 6e-12.  That would be stated as simply p < .001
*	Do not state p-values with a long string of 0s, e.g. p < .00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001.  That would be p < .001
*	Any p-value greater than .001 should be written as the exact p-value to three decimal places.  p = .123
* Try to avoid putting a 0 before the decimal place in p-values. It should be p = .012 and not p = 0.012 for example.
*	Give appropriate effect sizes (e.g. cohen's d).
*	Remember to give appropriate spacing (whitespace) between values and letters in inferential output, e.g. t(18) = 3.12, p = .14, and not t(18)=3.12, p=.14. This is both about being professional and not cheating the word count.
* Remember that more often than not, unless you are running a whole bunch of analyses, inferential results should be presented just as part of the paragraph. Not in some special font, with a box round them, a separate paragraph, or a cat pointing to them regaling their awesomeness. Just some normal text in the sentence.
*	Remember to state what test you are using: e.g. pearson correlation; spearman correlation; Welch's between-subjects t-test.
* Finish an individual analysis by interpreting results in context of hypothesis (direction and size of difference)
* The hypothesis at the end is a reiteration in terms of whether the hypothesis was accepted or not and with a very brief interpretation. "The results support the hypothesis that…suggesting that stress does have an impact on forum post length due to a dislocation of keyboard inhibition".
*	No prolonged discussion in the results section. That is what the discussion is for. A brief interpretation in the results section is expected.

# Discussion
  
* Starts just after the end of the Results and does not take a new page.
* Starts with the word "Discussion" centered and in bold.
* The Discussion should aim to roughly follow the similar idea of the Narrow to Broad structure – summary of results > relate your results to literature and theory mentioned in introduction > possible limitations and future directions > conclusions
* Think of the whole report as an hourglass and we are now nearing the bottom. The broad to narrow approach that you took in the introduction is now reversed in that you want to go narrow (your findings) to broad (how your findings relate to previous work and theory).
*	Start by briefly stating the results in context of the hypothesis.
*	Avoid putting numbers and figures in the discussion, just a summary of the results in words.
*	Don't worry if hypothesis is not supported. Don't automatically assume the finding is wrong. Explore reasons for null effect, theoretical or methodological, and then perhaps limitations of study that may lead to null – limited power, etc.
*	No one way to write a Discussion but basic it would be a summary of findings, relation to papers, relation to theory, caveats and future studies, conclusion.
*	First paragraph is usually the summary and last paragraph is usually the conclusion. In between that, each paragraph can cover a different section (one on relation to papers, one on relation to theory, one on limitations) or each paragraph can do all of these steps (e.g. highlight a particular finding, relate it to previous literature and theory, discussion and limitation and future study).
*	Weighting of different parts – we would recommended that the majority of the discussion would be better spent focussed on your own findings and relating them to theory and papers but this is just a rough ballpark. Keep in mind though when writing the discussion the ILO of evaluation and critical evaluation. Critical evaluation can be positive as well as not so positive.
* When relating your results to theory and papers, remember to actually compare to your own findings. Often people reiterate the previous findings but their own study gets lost of forgotten about.
* Evaluate your findings, don’t just describe them. What do your results mean? How do they fit into previous findings? If you think there’s a weakness to the study, what specific impact do you think it might have had on the results? 
* The discussion is not just reiterating the Introduction. It is about contextualising your findings in the field.
* Create a link to introduction by discussing the findings in relation to some of the findings mentioned in the Introduction. You can of course bring in new papers and research as well and expand the ideas but would be better to also link to those in the introduction and state why these are no longer relevant if that is the case.
  * This is where having some specific relevant details in the Introduction can help with the Discussion. If the results differ, or even if they align, thinking about the nuances of the different studies can help give lots to discuss.
* It is more than acceptable to bring in new theories and research into the discussion section but be careful not to completely disregard the introduction as this will create a disconnect between the two sections and the introduction and discussion should be related in terms of ideas.
*	The introduction and discussion should link together somehow. They are bookends to your study. And they should balance to some degree – avoid a really small discussion and long introduction, or vice versa.
*	Think about the thread that runs through the report from introduction through to the discussion. Don't view each section in isolation but consider the material in each section and how it relates back and forward. You should be able to draw links between the introduction and discussion as the introduction brings information as to what is known before your study and the discussion places your findings in that literature and relates your finding to previous work. Compare, contrast, link.
*	Where appropriate, state aims for future research or possible future research questions to be investigated - your discussion shouldn't try to overreach your findings. You can't answer all the questions and it is fine to flag some up for future work. The key thing is to think of ones that are relevant and try to support them with citations. A future direction for any study in humans is to go run it in dogs and see what happens and I could write that in any paper - but that doesn't mean it is relevant. In some cases it will be - if I want to know if dogs have specific regions of the brain associated with different human vocal personalities - but in other cases it wont be. You as the writer have to make the points salient and relevant to the reader.
* Future directions are not just about thinking of everything and anything. One or two relevant and supported ideas is enough.
* Future directions and limitations can focus on the scale used or a different scale but again think about why this is relevant. This is also a good example of when highlighting reliability, validity, procedure, in the methods and introduction can be beneficial. This point is easier made if that relevant information has already been laid out in the writing.
*	Think about resolving your limitations. Most "limitations" that people state are actually still valid means of conducting the study or are still relevant to the field so it is ok to suggest it as a limitation but to also resolve it. E.g. self-report responses always have issues of bias and future studies may want to change this method, however they are standard practice and when we compare to previous findings we see similar outcomes. So we are saying we know of the limitation, we know how to approach it in future, but we also think it is ok to still think about this study.
*	Don't be overly negative and discredit your own study - instead perhaps discuss in terms of generalisability. Limitations doesn't necessarily mean things that went wrong. It can mean the limitations of your finding in terms of generalising.
*	Use evidence to support all points in the discussion, including future directions and limitations. Bringing in the citations to support future directions and limitations helps to show the relevance.
*	Have a conclusion that includes a good take-home message - the most important thing you want people to take from this study
*	Always have a conclusion paragraph – think about how the world works in schemas and perhaps start it with "In conclusion, …."  Works the same way as writing your hypothesis as "We hypothesise…." And the current study paragraph as "In the current study…"  These are not essential but it improves the readability of your paper. So, have a general conclusion as your final paragraph.
* However no new theories or important ideas in the conclusion paragraph (the last paragraph) - this should only be the main message from the report.

# References

* Starts on a new page after the Discussion
* Starts with the word "References" centered and bold
*	This section is not included in the word count.
*	This section is called References and not Bibliography
*	APA formatting of references is required
*	References are presented in alphabetical order. They are not bullet-pointed. They are not numbered.
*	Keep to peer reviewed sources (avoid documentaries, youtube videos, songs, etc) as best as possible
*	If struggling to format references, if you search for the article in the University of Glasgow library, there is an icon that looks like quotation marks that helps give you a reference for each paper that you can copy and paste.
* Reference managers can make life very easy. Zetoro is a free one that is very useful.
* There should be a reference for every citation. 
* There should not be a reference for a piece of work if the work is not cited in the main report.

# Appendix

* The main appendix and really the only thing would be the pre-registration.
* Include your answers to the first 5 questions of the pre-registration and their references.
* You do not need to include the code but you can if easier.

# Word Count

*	There is no additional 10% to the word count (see AIS on Moodle). Submissions are checked for word count. Where the word count exceeds the maximum the marker will stop reading at that point regardless of where it is in the report, paragraph, or sentence.
*	Avoid breaking formatting rules to cheat word count. Find a better way of writing sentences to reduce words. Breaking the word count indicates that you are struggling to with the communication ILO and as such you are unlikely to receive the top grade on this element.
*	No lower word count but consider if there are areas you need to add more detail or give further description to help build your research question, justification, discussion of theory, etc.

# General Writing

*	The first draft and the last draft are two different documents. That is why we encourage you to spend the time now to think and write, and the last few days to edit and polish. Think, Write, Edit, Polish, Submit.
*	Try to mix up where you use citations a little in your writing. For instance, it can get a bit repetitive to have the citation positioned always at the end of the sentence (Scott and Woods, 2019). Try starting the sentence with the citation as well, e.g. "Scott and Woods (2019) showed that.....
*	Likewise, if you have to run a short list of things, it can help the reader by putting the citations after each finding. E.g. "voices have been shown to influence voting behavior (citation 1), mate attraction (citation 2), and group cohesion (citation 3)".  Just putting all the citations at the end can be confusing as the order of the citations is predetermined by the APA guidelines, and not the order of findings in your sentence (citation 2; citation 1; citation 3).
*	Don't put the title of the journal article in the main body of the report - for example, in the Introduction, "In the paper, Hocus Pocus got no focus on the Locus of Control by BeetleJuice and colleagues (2010)" - this just wastes words. All you need is the citation. The reference section is for all the other information if someone wants to look up the work.
*	Avoid quotes - writing in your own voice, with your own consistent tone, making sure that your point is clear is much better than assuming a reader understands the quote out of context.
*	Avoid rhetorical questions. Again not a hard and fast rule, but who are you asking? Rephrase your sentence.
*	Look for ways to reduce your word count.   For example, "A study by Stevenson and Dawydiak (2018) found that....", can easily be reduced to "Stevenson and Dawydiak (2018) found that....."  and if you are linking it to another study, then maybe "Likewise, Stevenson and Dawydiak (2018) found.....". Remember that one part of evaluation is to link studies together conceptually.
*	Watch out for the logic of your citations.  "Many studies have found that.........(Horlin and McNair, 2019)".  One citation does not fit with "Many studies".  Unless of course the paper you are citing is a review, which is fine, but change the sentence to "As reviewed by Horlin and McNair (2019), numerous studies have found....." or even "Many studies have found that.....(see Horlin and McNair (2019) for a review).
*	Similarly, there is a timeline to citations that you should try not to break.  "McNair and McAleer (2019) found that........  However, more recently, Stevenson and Woods (2017) found.....".  This would break the timeline as 2019 comes after 2017 and doesn't make sense.
*	Watch out for using the word 'recently'.  "Recently, it has been found that.......(Paterson and Scott, 2005)".  Not that recent really.  Recent would be the last 5 years. Maybe 5-10 years at a push.
*	Think about ways of reducing the word count in the methods as well.  "We will look to run 100 participants of which 50 will be male and 50 will be female. They will be from an age range of 18 years old to 22 years old".  Could be reduced to "We will run 100 participants (50 male; 50 female) aged between 18 and 22 years old."
*	Avoid abbreviations. Only a few select terms in Psychology should actually be abbreviated. When you make up your own abbreviations that are really only know to you, for a reader this can become impenetrable. "An fMRI study found..." is totally fine; most will understand what it means.  "A study on HPP in MV and FV using reversed and forward speech gives the conditions of MVR, MVF, FVR, and FVF" probably won't mean much to anybody even if you did know the paper was on High Pitch Preference in Male and Female voices. And even then it is still very hard to read. So avoid abbreviations.
*	Again look to other ways to reduce your word count through tightening the words you are using. For example, "In 1944, the famous psychologists Heider and Simmel showed that..."  whereas we would write just, "Heider and Simmel (1944) showed....".  Citation format is there to save words really.
* Avoid the historical approach of writing, "In 1944, the psychologists, Franz Heider and Marianne Simmel showed....." Use citations instead, "Heider and Simmel (1944) showed....."
* Avoid assuming the gender of a researcher. More often than not we would stick to surnames and not state gender.
*	Avoid reducing the word count through poor formatting. WeSeeEverything (McAleer, Paterson,Woods, Dawydiak,Stevenson, Wilson-Smith, McNair,Horlin &Scott,2019). This really impacts on your communication. 
* There is a lot more ways to reduce the word count but the only way that is accepted and shows best practice is to edit your own writing.
*	Stimuli is the plural of stimulus
*	Research is an acceptable plural of research. E.g. "Previous research has shown....." and not "Previous researches......"
* Try to reduce ambiguity in your writing by looking for places you use "they, them, it's". Just stating specifically what is meant can be much easier to read - but can be tricky with word counts. However, "McAleer et al., (2014) showed participants like voices. They rated voices..."  The "they" in this sentence is a little ambiguous and could be clarified to mean participants by reshaping the sentence or replacing the "they" with participants.
*	Read papers for style as well as content.
* Write with your writing hat on and redraft with your readers hat on.
